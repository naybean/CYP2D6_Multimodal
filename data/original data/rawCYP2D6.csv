Individuals carrying one or more reduced functional alleles (i.e. *9, *10, *17, *29, *36 and *41 alleles) and/or non-functional alleles (i.e. *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *11, *12, *13, *14, *15, *16, *19, *20, *21, *38, *40 and *42 alleles) were grouped together and compared with individuals carrying normal/increased function CYP2D6 alleles (i.e. *1, *2, *33 and *35 alleles). A 17 studies, >1,088 events in 9,555 participants could be incorporated into the analysis for composite of all-cause mortality, surrogate endpoints for overall survival as well as non-fatal breast cancer events.
